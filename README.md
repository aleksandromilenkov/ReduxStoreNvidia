# ReduxStoreNvidia

React JS Application for ordering Nvidia graphic cards.  
You can add the item you want to your card. The items are also added to a backend firebase server and when you refresh the page they are fetched inside the cart.  
This App is using Redux toolkit  
I created this app for learning purpuses. I learned advanced Redux where I created store, created 2 slices, 2 thunk action functions and more.  
The app is hosted here: https://aleksandromilenkov.github.io/ReduxStoreNvidia/
